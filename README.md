Curious about AI and machine-learning
I'm a student who's curious about coding and tech developments. Hoping to get a basic understanding of code interpretation. I'll be doing my own research alongside but if you have any recommended readings, tips or recomendations that would be great. I'm grateful for any help.Thx for your participation.
